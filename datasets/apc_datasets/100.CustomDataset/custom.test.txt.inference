I found this [B-ASP]Course[E-ASP] less well prepared than the previous 3 modules. Misleading hints in the assignments, code errors, etc... Also, I found the amount of work required higher, which is not in itself a bad thing, just a bit unexpected. $LABEL$ Negative

not bad... theres a big mistake in the regex video. [B-ASP]assignments[E-ASP] don' t really match the lectures. Without Corey Schafer and Sentdex on youtube I would' ve quit. $LABEL$ Negative

I am an engineer and I use matlab and stata for data analysis and currently taking Machine Learning course by Stanford which is fabulous. I did not like this [B-ASP]course[E-ASP] for the following reasons: 1- bad course design structure2- so confusing and inappropriate sequence $LABEL$ Negative
